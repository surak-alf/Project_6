EthioMart Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Overview

This project focuses on developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for EthioMart, a platform aiming to consolidate Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. The NER system will extract key business entities (product names, prices, locations) from text, images, and documents shared across Telegram channels. This extracted data will be used to populate EthioMart's centralized database, making it a comprehensive e-commerce hub.

Business Need

EthioMart aims to become the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. However, the current decentralized landscape of independent e-commerce channels presents challenges for both vendors and customers.

To address this, EthioMart plans to create a single centralized platform that consolidates data from multiple Telegram channels. This will provide a seamless experience for customers to explore and interact with multiple vendors in one place.

Key Objectives

Real-time data extraction: Extract data from Telegram channels in real-time.
Fine-tuning LLM for NER: Develop a high-accuracy NER system for Amharic text, images, and documents.
Technical Approach

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of Amharic text, images, and documents containing e-commerce-related information.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for model training.
Model Selection: Choose a suitable Large Language Model (LLM) for Amharic NER.
Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the LLM on the collected dataset to improve performance.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Deployment: Integrate the NER system into the EthioMart platform for real-time data extraction.
